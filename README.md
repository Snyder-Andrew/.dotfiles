# .dotfiles - CSCE 215 Homework 02

This repository contains configuration files and scripts to customize your Linux shell environment. It includes setup scripts for `.bashrc`, `.nanorc`, and various utilities for managing the Linux shell.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. **`.bashrc` Customization (`./etc/bashrc_custom`)**
This file contains customizations for the bash shell environment. It includes:
- **Environment Variables**: Adds the current directory to the `PATH` to make local executables easily accessible.
- **Aliases**: Defines common shortcuts for common commands, such as:
  - `cdd` for `cd ..`
  - `lsa` for `ls -A`
  - `lsl` for `ls -l`
  - `lsal` for `ls -Al`
  - `targz` and `untar` functions for compressing and extracting `.tar.gz` files.
  - `trash` for moving files to a `.TRASH` directory instead of deleting them.
  - `rmtrash` to permanently remove the contents of `.TRASH`.

### 2. **`.nanorc` Configuration (`./etc/nanorc`)**
This file contains the configuration for the `nano` text editor. By default, this file is copied to your home directory as `.nanorc`. It customizes `nano`'s behavior, but you can modify it further if needed.

### 3. **Setup Script (`./bin/linux.sh`)**
The `linux.sh` script sets up the environment by:
- Checking if the operating system is Linux.
- Creating a `.TRASH` directory in your home directory if it doesn't exist.
- Backing up the existing `.nanorc` file (if present).
- Copying the `./etc/nanorc` file to the home directory as `.nanorc`.
- Adding a line to your `.bashrc` to source `bashrc_custom`.

### 4. **Cleanup Script (`./bin/cleanup.sh`)**
The `cleanup.sh` script reverts the changes made by `linux.sh`:
- Removes the `.nanorc` file from the home directory.
- Removes the line that sources `bashrc_custom` from `.bashrc`.
- Deletes the `.TRASH` directory.

### 5. **Makefile**
The `Makefile` defines two targets:
- **`linux`**: Runs the `linux.sh` script to set up the environment.
- **`clean`**: Runs the `cleanup.sh` script to undo the changes made by `linux.sh`.

### 6. **`.gitignore`**
The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the following files:
- `.DS_Store`: A macOS system file.
- `linuxsetup.log`: The log file generated by the setup script.

### 7. **`README.md`**
This file. It describes the purpose and usage of the repository.
